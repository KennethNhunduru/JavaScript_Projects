### Introduction

Intended Audience: Course instructors and anyone interested in web development and coding in general.

This repository will be home to all my JavaScript coding projects on the Web Design and Software Development Diploma Course.
 
JavaScript is one of the three main languages that web developers need to learn, with the other two being HTML and CSS. With HTML we define the content of web pages, whilst with CSS we specify the layout and styling of the web pages. JavaScript enables us to program the behaviour of the web pages thereby automating and animating the dynamic content of the web pages.

### Technologies
The structure of the web pages will be based on the latest HTML5 standard.
The layout of the web pages will be formatted using the Cascading Style Sheets 3 (CSS3) language.
The programming of the dynamic content will be based on all versions of JavaScript as follows:

- The Original JavaScript ES1 ES2 ES3 (1997-1999)
- The First Main Revision ES5 (2009)
- The Second Revision ES6 (2015)
- The Yearly Additions (2016, 2017 ... 2021, 2022)

### Contact
All comments and improvement suggestions for the projects are welcome.
I can be contacted on my email <knhunduru@hotmail.com> for any comments and/or suggestions

### JavaScript Projects
These are some of the small projects I made using JavaScript:

#### Projects
- Pizza Menu
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game
- Calculator
- ToDo App

#### Pizza Menu
This project is esseentially a one-page website that facilitates the ordering of pizza with various toppings online.
It presents the customer with their inputed order prior to calculation of the total order price and subsequent confirmation of the order.

#### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The Tic Tac Toe game (also called Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os, x o game, XOX Game, 3 in a row) not only helps to pass time but also improves problem-solving skills. 
The first player to align 3 of their identical symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.
The game/computer randomly rolls dice to determine which player goes first. Users can choose which token each player wants to use.

#### Calculator
This project is about achieving simple calculator functionality using JavaScript. The calculator performs basic functions such as add, subtract, multiply and divide.

#### ToDo App
The ToDo app enables users to create and maintain a list of tasks scheduled for their day, week, month etc.. The app affords them the capability to add, edit, and remove task as they are accomplished.
